# Riiverse

## Q&A

### What is Riiverse?
Riiverse is a Miiverse Revival project for the 3DS (or anything with the screen size 320x432px).

### How do I install Riiverse?
Currently Riiverse is in development, but we sometimes host public betas, we are not planning for a patcher because you can just open a website on your 3DS.

### How can I follow Riiverse's development?

### How come the game/app *insert name here* doesn't work as intended!
As said before, it's just a website.

### What about Pretendo?
Pretendo is a seperate network for Wii U and 3DS, they're offering their own miiverse clone, juxtaposition.
